The "libehht" C library specifies a basic object oriented hash-table
interface and implementation.

The "ehht-interface.h" file declares the "ehht_s" struct and
function pointer definitions, but does not specify an implementation.

The "ehht.h" includes the interface as well as a constructor and
destructor for an implementation of the interface.
